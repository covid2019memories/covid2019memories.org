content: The purpose of this site is to let people around the world see the light of humanity still shining under the serious epidemic.
  The way we do it is, on top of the many projects that are already active on Github, it's possible to pull together information from a variety of sources,
  organize it through machine learning method, and present it in a more user friendly way. In terms of content, we are consistent with the nCovMemory project,
  including media coverage, non-fiction, and personal narratives. We respect the copyright of the original authors and provide only the full text of the machine translation.
  If you think that we have infringed your copyright, please contact us and we will remove the relevant articles.
  We hope that when this epidemic is over, this site will be part of a global memorial network.
